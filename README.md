#### An overview by [jalvarado91](https://github.com/jalvarado91)

Soulector is many things: an experiment, a tool, an expression self, and a way to give back to a small community.


At the most ovbious it's a music player. As a tool, it's an easy and delightful way of introducing people to what I (and a like minded community) believe is a different and interesting way of experiencing music. 

At deeper layer it's an aggregation and curation of long form mixes by Selectors and collectives that have had an impact in my music journey.

And as an experiment, it's also a test bench for different technoligies through time. This repo in itself is v2 which continues efforts from the original repo at [jalvarado91/soulector](https://github.com/jalvarado91/soulector).

As a core principle, soulector should always be open, and built with purpose. UX is paramount and iterated on carefully with with intent. And in the spirit of being accessible, soulector leverages and pushes the web at it's core. 

I hope you get something from it too.
